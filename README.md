# Random-Word-Generator
Generate random fake words based on the letter occurrence distribution in the English language

## Distribution file structure

Each line consists of 4 parts:
1. 1 char: the letter it self
2. 2 chars: number of n+1 combinations that start with this n long combination
3. 2 chars: degree of the polynomial to approximate the distribution
4. 1-k chars: character that can follow this combination
